# Projects #

A few things I've worked on in my free time.

<div id="ttfrm-banner" class="project-banner"></div>

## [Ttfrm][ttfrm] ##

3D Rigid Transforms in C++ with frame checking. A slightly opinionated
header-only, templated library built on top of Eigen. Promotes the use
of quaternions for faster composition and interpolation.

<div id="trollauncher-banner" class="project-banner"></div>

## [Trollauncher][trollauncher] ##

Trollauncher is a utility to manage modpacks and launcher profiles
with the "Vanilla" Minecraft Launcher. It's not actually a launcher.
It works with recent versions of Minecraft (even after the big v1.13
Forge rewrite). Available for Windows and Linux!

<div id="kb-firmware-banner" class="project-banner"></div>

## [Keyboard Firmware][kb_firmware] ##

I love my Ergodox. So naturally I've customized the firmware to make
it even better! This is my custom keymap, built on top of QMK.

<div id="grid-engine-banner" class="project-banner"></div>

## [Grid Engine][grid_engine] ##

Grid Engine is a work-in-progress library for building cellular
automata and pixel based games. Written in C with idiomatic APIs to
encourage learning and experimentation.

<div id="dotfiles-banner" class="project-banner"></div>

## [Dotfiles][dotfiles] ##

My Emacs config as well as some other odds and ends. Not at all
packaged up, but maybe useful for inspiration? Your mileage may vary.

<div id="screeps-banner" class="project-banner"></div>

## [Screeps][screeps] ##

Screeps is a game where you program *creeps* to gather resources,
build bases, and combat other colonies. Written in TypeScript.

<div id="vr-maze-banner" class="project-banner"></div>

## [VR Maze][vr_maze] ##

A fairly simple VR maze built with Unity for Google VR. Uses a
waypoint system for navigation. Completed as a final project for a
Udacity course [VR Software Development][vr_course].
