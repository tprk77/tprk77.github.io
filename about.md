# About #

My name is Tim and I'm a programmer. I usually have too many projects and not
enough time. If I'm not working in my go-to language C++, I'm probably trying
out a new language to learn something new. My interests range from 3D math to
cellular automata, from video games to text editors, from middleware to keyboard
firmware. I'm also a big fan of robots.
